# Diddy vs The Kingdom

First milestone project for the Full Stack Developer course with the code institute. This is based on a new band that i am a part of. The project has to be written in HTML and CSS, and there is the option of using Bootstrap and other frameworks or libraries.

## Mandatory Points

1. Static front end
    - Custom HTML5 and CSS3 to create a website of at least 3 pages.
2. Information Architecture
    - Main Navigation menu and Structured layout.
3. Documentation
    - README.md file
4. Version Control
    - Git and GitHub for version Control
5. Attribution
    - Maintain clear seperation between user and External
6. Deployment
    - Deploy final version to hosting platform.


### Description

The project is a webpage to promote the band, give some information about the band and members, linking to social media and ability to contact.

##### Landing

Starting with a landing page type screen. This initially was going to be a home page, with a carousel of images and information about the band. This got changed to be a static landing page, with the bands name/logo in the centre of the page, a tagline, and then with a navbar at the top to go to the main parts of the site. Social media links to the bands pages.
