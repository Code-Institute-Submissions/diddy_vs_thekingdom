# Diddy vs The Kingdom

This project is my first milestone project for the Full Stack Web Developer Course with Code Institue. It will be designed for the band that has recently formed that i am part of. We have been practicing for almost a year now, with some social media pages, but a useable website would help the band promote itself and be able to get further and have a visual internet presence. 

As The band is very new there is nothing on the page about shows or albums, but there is information about the band all together in one place for interested people to be able to get a sense of the band. As it is controlled by myself as part of the band, it will be easy to add things and develop the website further as the band progresses. 

The band is very light hearted and as well as being passionate about music, they are passionate about gaming and the band is based around Nintendo games; Diddy Kong Racing' and 'Mario Kart', so I will be looking to try and keep the light hearted feel and relation to these games through the website. 

## **UX**

The purpose of the website is to be able to give a web page that would show up in searches for the band and a central point for information, rather than relying on social media. with this is mind i had to think about what the user would need. 

- As a user, I want to be able to read about the band, so i can tell if they are something I'm interested in.
- As a user, I want to be able to know who is in the band and what they do, to give me a sense of the lineup.
- As a user, I want to be able to hear some of the music to see if i like it. 
- As a user, If i want to talk to the band or book for a show, i want to be able to get in touch.

As part of the band, it was useful to know what we currently have and be able to talk to the other members to see what we are trying to do and what might be needed. It should be very quick and easy to determine what they want and be able to make small changes to suit needs.

#### Wireframe Designs:

I started with making a fair few wireframe designs, i could have done these using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), and started to, but there was lots of different ideas to replicate, so I drew out a lot of different wireframe ideas and then sat with the band to determine what layouts looked good to them and what different parts were good.

<img src="./img/wireframes/wireframe2.jpg" width="450" height="350">
<img src="./img/wireframes/wireframe3.jpg" width="450" height="175">

Being able to talk and get opinions from everyone made it easier to develop further designs and take all the features that were good, this is why there is a lot of different wireframes. There was some settling on ideas, but as the project developed from my end, some things didnt work, or werent as user friendly as possible, so i have taken the ideas and tweaked them to make things sit better.

### ***Existing Features***

**Navbar**
- Used across all pages, showing the available pages on the site and incorporating the band logo along with social media links.
- At Tablet size devices and smaller, the social links move to the footer.
- At Phone size devices the menu collapses into a slide down menu.

**Landing Page**
- Taking inspiration from a lot of other band websites, they use a landing page, which is simple and quick to see. 
- Main part of the landing page has a large band logo in the middle, with a tagline underneath, not giving the user too much info to read, just the desire to go into the site further.

**The Band**

- Band members, with a 9 peice band this enabled this to be a large part, taking inspiration from a 'Mario Kart' character selection screen.
